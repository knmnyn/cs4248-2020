Due to high demand, we understand that many students who are interested in the module may not be able to secure it.  Unfortunately, this is going to be the case, and because this is an elective module, there's nothing we can do about that.  However, you may opt to audit the class or attempt to take another related NLP course, [CS6101](https://github.com/knmnyn/cs6101-2020) on *Conversational Recommendation Systems*, but that is strictly more advanced (and will require a lot of self-study as it is normally a graduate module).  We note that CS4248 is offered both semesters a year now, so you can take it next semester as well.
