Note that our class will be in the physical venue of LT19.  Recordings will take place where possible by Zoom (see LumiNUS for details; there will likely be a remote attendance option; we'll see how it goes), and uploaded to LumiNUS.

<p><sup>1</sup>Exam considerations were decided at the beginning of April 2020 for the entire academic year.  At that time, we thought it was safer not to require a physical final exam venue.  Fortunately, we can have class in place, but the exam considerations needed to be moved to online continuous assessment only at that time.  We regret any inconvenience.
